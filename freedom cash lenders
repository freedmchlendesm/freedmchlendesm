A car title loan is also a loan made for a short period of time. They often last for only 30 days. To get a car title loan, you give the lender the title to your vehicle. The lender gives you cash and keeps the title to your vehicle. When it’s time to repay the loan, you have to pay the lender the amount you borrowed plus a fee. Car title loans can be very expensive. Here’s an example:

    You want to borrow $1,000 for 30 days.
    The fee is 25%. To borrow $1,000, that’s $250.
    When it’s time to repay the lender in 30 days, you pay him $1,250.

Car title loans also are risky. If you can’t repay the money you owe, the lender might take your vehicle from you. He could sell it and keep the money, leaving you without transportation. This video shows what can happen.
